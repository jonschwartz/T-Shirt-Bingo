<p>Playing the game is pretty easy.  If you see a shirt, click the "Saw it!" button (see the green box above).  If you can't tell if the person you're looking at is wearing the shirt you're trying to find, click the [+] (see the orange box above) to enlarge the image (where available... Sorry, Woot won't let us grab the bigger images).  Want to buy the shirt?  Just click on it (see blue box above) and you'll be taken to the page where you can buy it (if its still for sale).</p>
